Topic: Introduction

Thank you for trying the Audio Processing Library for Flash (ALF) developed by the Music and Entertainment Technology Lab in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Drexel University. This library is intended to streamline audio playback, modification, and feature extraction for Flash applications using Actionscript 3. Using ALF, it is simple to play .wav and .mp3 audio files while synchronizing visual events with the audio to create applications that are highly music centric/reactive.

Developers who do not require significant control over the manner in which playback occurs are directed to use <ALF.as>. Those who want lower level control over the dynamic audio playback functionality of Actionscript3 should read the documentation on <DATF.as>.

To download the library as well as view a demo application please go to http://music.ece.drexel.edu/ALF. A class diagram showing the relationship between the classes involved in the library are shown below.
